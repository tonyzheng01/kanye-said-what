# What is this?
This is a game I, Tony Zheng, created. I selected one line from every song on every solo Kanye West album and blanked out some of the words. Try to guess what Kanye said.

# What did you use to make this?
React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Styled Components

# What albums?
1. The College Dropout
2. Late Registration
3. Graduation
4. 808s & Heartbreak
5. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy
6. Yeezus
7. The Life of Pablo
8. ye
9. Jesus Is King

Notably, albums that are left off are: Cruel Summer, Watch the Throne, and Kids See Ghosts.
I love those albums, but they're collab albums.

# What's the easter egg?
Play it and find out.

# TODO (maybe?)
1. Make it mobile friendly
2. Take a UX class
3. Make an API to serve the lyrics
4. Add upcoming albums? :)
